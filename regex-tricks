  $pattern = '/<!-- <script async(.*)<\/amp-analytics>/s';
  $templateText = preg_replace($pattern, '', $templateText);
It depends on the language, but there should be a modifier that you can add to the regex pattern. In PHP it is:
/(.*)<FooBar>/s
The s at the end causes the dot to match all characters including newlines.
